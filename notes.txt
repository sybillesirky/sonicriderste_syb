BASIC EXLOAD FILES:
exloads.cpp
exloads.hpp
main.hpp (this is where the enum for EXLoads is defined)
separatemodelloading.cpp (for Gear model swaps, check StardustSpeeder)
rodata.s (colour values for HUD/Boost)

GEAR STRUCTS:
data.s (the Gear stats such as who can select it are in here)

GEAR STAT CHANGES:
Gear stats are stored in the /gears folder by name.
They are activated in handlers.cpp, literally going through all of them and going:
"if (player->extremeGear != GEAR NAME) return;".

CHARACTER STRUCTS:
These can be found in rodata.s. Find them with the comment.

ADDING FILES:
All .cpp files need to be added in CMakeLists.txt. Can find them easily enough with the pointer.
